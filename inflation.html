                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL" target="_blank" class="orange-link">Nearly 80% of all US Dollars that exist today were created between 2020 and 2023.</a> This was a huge expansion of the US Dollar money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the US Dollar system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">US Dollars have lost 90% of their purchasing power since 1950</span> as politicians printed more of them. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.

                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a dollar is made up of 100 cents, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        As more dollars are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the dollars you have buy you less as time goes on. Because so many dollars were printed over the last few years, the value of the dollars in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 1 in 5 Canadian Dollars that exist today were created between 2020 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the Canadian Dollar money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Canadian Dollar system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <h3>HAS BITCOIN EVER BEEN HACKED?</h3>

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <p>Bitcoin uses energy to secure the network and ensures the Bitcoin you own can’t be taken from you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.
                        <br /><br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin is the most secure computer network in the world.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin helps stabilize the Texas

                        &mdash; Bitcoin reduces emissions from oil drilling.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin still uses less energy than

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        In the Eurozone, there is no fixed limit on how many Euros can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more Euros are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the Euros you have buy you less as time goes on. Because so many Euros were printed over the last few years, the value of the Euros in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">About 1 in 4 Euros that exist today were created between 2020 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the Euro money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Euro system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.

                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        In the United Kingdom, there is no fixed limit on how many British Pounds can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more pounds are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the pounds you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many pounds were printed over the last few years, the value of the pounds in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">About 1 in 4 British Pounds that exist today were created between 2020 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the British Pound system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">British Pounds have lost 90% of their purchasing power since 1950</span> as politicians printed more of them. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />
                            <img loading="lazy" src="img/volatility-small.png" class="inline"/>
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a pound is made up of 100 pence, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is £50,000 then £1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.

                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In Brazil, there is no fixed limit on how many Brazilian reais can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more reais are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the reais you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many reais were printed over the last few years, the value of the reais in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">About 40% of all Brazilian reais that exist today were created between 2020 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Brazilian Real system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <h3>CAN BITCOIN PROTECT MY MONEY FROM INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Brazilian reais money supply increased from R$427 billion to R$589 billion in just 2 years</span> as politicians printed more of them. This was a nearly 40% increase in the money supply, as illustrated in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.
                        <br /><br />
                            <img loading="lazy" src="img/real-money-supply.png" class="inline"/>
                        <br /><br />
                        In 2020, the Brazilian government printed a new R$200 bill. Just this new bill was equal to 12.8% of all reais printed that year!
                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a real is made up of 100 centavos, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is R$50,000 then R$1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <br /><br />
                        As more pesos are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the pesos you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many pesos were printed over the last few years, the value of the pesos in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Nearly 50% of all Philippine pesos that exist today were created between 2020 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Philippine Peso system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Philippine Peso money supply has nearly doubled since 2020</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Mexican Peso system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.

                        <span class="bold">The Mexican Peso money supply has nearly doubled since 2016</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a peso is made up of 100 centavos, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

                        As more rupees are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the rupees you have buy you less as time goes on.

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 50% of all Indian rupees that exist today were created between 2016 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.

                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a rupee is made up of 100 paise, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is ₹50,000 then ₹1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        In Honduras, there is no fixed limit on how many Honduran Lempiras can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more lempiras are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the lempiras you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many lempiras were printed over the last few years, the value of the lempiras in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 50% of all Honduran lempiras that exist today were created between 2016 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Honduran lempira system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.

                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a lempira is made up of 100 centavos, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is L50,000 then L1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <p>Bitcoin uses energy to secure the network and ensures the Bitcoin you own can’t be taken from you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.
                        <br /><br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin is the most secure computer network in the world.<br />

                        &mdash; Bitcoin reduces emissions from oil drilling.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin still uses less energy than

                        <br /><br />
                        In Venezuela, there is no fixed limit on how many Venezuelan bolívares can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more bolívares are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the bolívares you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many bolívares were printed over the last few years, the value of the bolívares in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 80% of all Venezuelan bolívares that exist today were created in the last year!</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Venezuelan bolívar system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Venezuelan bolívar money supply has increased by more than 500% in the last year</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. The money supply has increased exponentially from where it was just a few years ago, which is why inflation is out of control. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.
                        <br /><br />
                            <img loading="lazy" src="img/venezuelan-bolivar-money-supply.png" class="inline"/>
                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        <br /><br />
                        As more yen are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the yen you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many yen were printed over the last few years, the value of the yen in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 25% of all Japanese Yen that exist today were created between 2016 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Japanese Yen system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?></h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Japanese Yen money supply has increased by more than 33% since 2016</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>1 yen is the smallest unit of currency in Japan. However, just like a US Dollar is made up of 100 cents, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is ¥500,000 then ¥1 buys you 200 sats!

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.

                        In Australia, there is no fixed limit on how many Australian Dollars can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more dollars are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the dollars you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many dollars were printed over the last few years, the value of the dollars in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h3>WHAT CAUSES<br />INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">More than 50% of all Australian Dollars that exist today were created between 2016 and 2022.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Australian Dollar system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Australian Dollar money supply has increased by more than 100% since 2016</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />
                            <img loading="lazy" src="img/volatility-small.png" class="inline"/>
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a dollar is made up of 100 cents, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is $A50,000 then A$1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Inflation happens when more money is printed or created from thin air. This makes your money worth less over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In Israel, there is no fixed limit on how many Israeli Shekels can be created.
                        <br /><br />
                        As more shekels are created through budget deficits and new spending bills, the shekels you have buy you less as time goes on.  Because so many shekels were printed over the last few years, the value of the shekels in your bank account and pocket have decreased significantly over time.

                        <p>While supply chains and some corporations contribute to artificially rising prices, the root cause of inflation is the expansion of the money supply.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">About 50% of all Israeli Shekels that exist today were created between 2016 and 2023.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.

                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Israeli Shekel system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.

                        <span class="bold">The Israeli Shekel money supply has increased by about 100% since 2016</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a shekel is made up of 100 agoras, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is ₪50,000 then ₪1 buys you 2,000 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">About 35% of all Thai baht that exist today were created between 2016 and 2023.</span> This was a huge expansion of the money supply and will not be the last time this happens.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        When more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up. This includes the raw materials costs companies have to pay for their products, which means higher prices for you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money becomes worth less over time.</p>

                        <h3>DOES BITCOIN HAVE INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Inflation is essentially your piece of the "money pie" getting smaller each year. So does Bitcoin have inflation?
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21,000,000 (21 million) bitcoin that will ever exist. The 21 million supply limit is fixed in code and secured by the most powerful computing network in the world, called The Bitcoin Network. This limit cannot be changed.
                        <br /><br />
                        While Bitcoin doesn't have inflation, it does have issuance. Issuance is the percent of new Bitcoin mined each year. Bitcoin miners secure the network, process Bitcoin transactions, and get paid for their work.
                        <br /><br />
                        More than 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined. More than 99% of all 21 million bitcoin will have been mined by the 2030s, and the remaining less than 1% will be mined by the year 2140.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even though there is issuance up to the fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, the entire point is that your slice of the 21 million bitcoin pie never gets smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the Thai baht system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Thai baht money supply has increased by about 50% since 2016</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a baht is made up of 100 satang, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is ฿500,000 then ฿1 buys you 200 sats!

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.

                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.

This is in sharp contrast to the New Zealand Dollar system where your slice of the pie gets smaller every year when more money is printed from thin air. <span class="bold">You can't print more bitcoin.</span>

                        <h3>WHAT IS<br />BITCOIN?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin is 2 things: a digital money and a computer network. You can send Bitcoin (the digital money) directly to other people using The Bitcoin Network (the computer network).<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a radically new way to store and transact value. Unlike normal financial networks, The Bitcoin Network is able to operate without central authorities or trusted administrators. That makes Bitcoin the first ever open and borderless money.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is digital money that gives you complete ownership over your wealth. For the first time in human history everyone can own an asset that is truly scarce, doesn't require permission to be used, and can't be confiscated when stored properly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">Bitcoin allows anyone to store their wealth safely and securely</span> without worrying about the government stealing it or inflating away its value through money printing.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can easily self-custody your Bitcoin to take full control of it, giving you full access to the power of Bitcoin. If you can download an app, you can self-custody Bitcoin and store your wealth without relying on anyone else.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin is better money.</p>

                        <h3>CAN BITCOIN PROTECT MY MONEY FROM INFLATION?</h3>

                        <p>Bitcoin has historically been great at protecting people from the inflation of their local currency. Many people who use Bitcoin as an inflation hedge store money that they can afford to keep as Bitcoin for a long period of time.

                        <span class="bold">The New Zealand Dollar money supply has increased by about 100% since 2010</span> as politicians printed more of them. You can see this in the chart below. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it the best way to save your money for the long term.

                        <br /><br />
                        When you save in Bitcoin, everything tends to get cheaper in the long run. With government currency, everything tends to get more expensive.

                        <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but the volatility observed on a day-to-day basis "disappears" in the long term.
                        <br /><br />
                            <img loading="lazy" src="img/volatility-small.png" class="inline"/>
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin continues to get less and less volatile over time. As more people use Bitcoin as a long term savings account, the more its value stabilizes.
                        <br /><br />
                        Many people choose to store value in Bitcoin for many years as a safe way to minimize the risk of volatility and protect their purchasing power over time.
                        <br /><br />
                        In some countries, such as Venezuela, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Argentina, Turkey, and so many others, the value of the local currency inflates away so quickly that Bitcoin is seen as the more stable way to save money.

                        <p>Just like a dollar is made up of 100 cents, a bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 (100 million) sats.

                        You don’t have to own a whole bitcoin. Most people just own sats. Sats are fractions of a bitcoin. For example, if 1 whole bitcoin is $50,000 then $1 buys you 200 sats!

                        <h3>HAS BITCOIN EVER BEEN HACKED?</h3>

                        <p>You  may have heard about a "Bitcoin hack" in the news. Most people read these articles and believe the Bitcoin Network has been hacked when that is not the case.
                        <br /><br />
                        What's the Bitcoin Network? Well, think of Bitcoin the currency as a train. The Bitcoin Network is the train tracks.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">When you read about a Bitcoin hack in the news, you're reading about a custodian getting hacked.</span> Custodians are companies that hold your Bitcoin for you. However, that comes with a risk: losing your Bitcoin when the company mismanages it or goes out of business. This happens frequently, which is why it's a better idea to self-custody your Bitcoin.
                        <br /><br />
                        The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can self-custody it. This means you can take full control over your Bitcoin by downloading your own Bitcoin wallet. This may sound complicated, but it is as easy as downloading an app.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="bold">The Bitcoin Network has never been hacked and is the most secure computer network in the world.</span> Even if you combined all the Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google servers, the Bitcoin Network would still be more powerful and more secure.

                        <p>Bitcoin uses energy to secure the network and ensures the Bitcoin you own can’t be taken from you.
                        <br /><br />
                        Bitcoin uses a significant amount of energy, and this is a great thing for many reasons.
                        <br /><br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin is the most secure computer network in the world.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin helps stabilize the Texas
                          energy grid with bitcoin mining.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin reduces emissions from oil drilling.<br />
                        &mdash; Bitcoin still uses less energy than
