	"point_3_summary_2": "CBDCs, much like the government currencies we use today, have no cap on total supply. This lack of cap on total supply allows the government to expand the money supply.",
	"point_3_summary_3": "This causes inflation.",

	"point_7_summary_1": "Bitcoin is designed to make it impossible for others to freeze your money. CBDCs are designed to make it easy for governments and central banks to freeze your money.",

	"point_9_summary_1": "Bitcoin has a predictable monetary policy that is fixed in code and can't be changed. CBDCs, like our currencies today, have a monetary policy that can easily be changed.",
	"point_9_summary_2": "This results in inflation when politicians print too much money.",
	"point_10_summary_1": "Bitcoin is the most secure computing network that has ever existed and has never been hacked. CBDCs rely on governments and banks to secure the network, which have been hacked countless times throughout history."
