## Mission
The mission of bitcoin.rocks is to accelerate bitcoin adoption through education.

We accomplish this with several free resources:

- [An educational website](https://bitcoin.rocks) designed for people who are new to bitcoin.
- [Bitcoin Stickers](https://bitcoin.rocks/stickers) that enable you to leave an orange pill in public.
- [Bitcoin Business Kits](https://bitcoin.rocks/business/kit) that enable you to get a local business to accept bitcoin payments.

## Website Overview
bitcoin.rocks is an educational website designed for people who are new to bitcoin. The website was founded in 2022 as a "first link" to send to people who ask you about bitcoin.

The main focus of the website is [the homepage](https://bitcoin.rocks) which links out to a variety of internal and external sources depending on the user's interests.

You can view the website here: https://bitcoin.rocks

## Website Architecture
The website is written in raw HTML / CSS / JS. This eliminates the burden of a CMS.

All text content is localized using jquery.i18n translation strings. You can see which translations are in progress in the [Translations forum.](https://github.com/sovenor/bitcoin-rocks/discussions/categories/translations) The website will dynamically serve the proper content depending on the user's browser language.

The Apache server handles redirects and removing ".html" from the end of links in a simple .htaccess file. The latest merged code is uploaded on https://bitcoin.rocks

## License
